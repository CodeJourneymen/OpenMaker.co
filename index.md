## Welcome to OpenMaker

This is a [Drupal 8](https://drupal.org) distribution (based off [Open Social](https://getopensocial.com)) for use by MakerSpaces - still in the alpha phase, but making progress.

Currently in use by [Chatt*Lab makerspace](https://chattlab.org)

100% Open source.
Host your own, or let us worry about backups, security and uptime for a small monthly fee - coming soon.

Trying to make Makerspace websites better, and not like Geocities is alive and well.

Always looking for contributors. Would like to help or learn more?  Then contact us.
