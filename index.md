## Welcome to OpenMaker

This is a Drupal 8 distribution (based off [Open Social](https://getopensocial.com)) for use by MakerSpaces.

100% Open source.
Host your own, or let us worry about backups, security and uptime for a small monthly fee.

Trying to make Makerspace websites better, and not like Geocities is alive and well.

Always looking for contributors. Would like to help or learn more?  Then contact us.

### Contact

[contact us](mailto:info@codejourneymen.com.com) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.
